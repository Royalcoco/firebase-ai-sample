This module defines the Visitor classes for the `Bluetooth` application configuration, which
is used to configure and customize how the `Bluetooth` server behaves when it is running.

The visitor pattern is a design pattern that allows you to add functionality to existing
classes without modifying their source code. It's an alternative to subclassing for adding
new behavior to an object. The idea behind the visitor pattern is to separate the algorithm
from the data structure by encapsulating them separately using visitors. In this case, we
use visitor patterns to provide default implementations of various aspects of the `Bluetooth`
server's behavior.

Visitors are implemented as subclasses of the base class `ConfigVisitor`, which provides
a basic implementation of all methods defined by the `ConfigVisitor` protocol. Each method
in the `ConfigVisitor` protocol has a docstring explaining what it does and what kind of
argument(s) it expects. You can refer to these docstrings for more information on each
method.

To define your own visitor, simply create   a new `ConfigVisitor` subclass and implement
the missing methods according to your needs. If a method is not implemented in your
subclass, Python will automatically call the corresponding method from the base class. This
allows you to override only the specific methods you need or leave the rest alone if you need
to use the defaults provided by the base class.

Here's an example of defining a simple visitor:

python
    class MyVisitor(ConfigVisitor):
        def visit_ServerSocket(self, socket):
            print("Found ServerSocket: %r" % socket)

    config = BluetoothAppConfiguration()
    config.add_socket(ServerSocket(...))  # Add some sockets to the config
    config.accept(MyVisitor())             # Use the MyVisitor to process the config

In this example, `MyVisitor` overrides the `visit_ServerSocket()` method but leaves all
other methods unimplemented, so they
will call through to the base class implementation. When the `config.accept()` method is called with
an instance of `MyVisitor()`, it will be passed every `ServerSocket` found in the config,
and "Found ServerSocket:" messages will be printed out.

Note that the `ConfigVisitor` class hierarchy is quite complex due to the many different types of methods.
If you don't need to modify all of the methods, it may be easier to start with one of the simpler classes like `AdapterConfigVisitor`.
If you don't need to modify all parts of the configuration, it may be simpler to just iterate over
the appropriate lists (`services`, `advertisements`, etc.) directly instead of using the visitor
pattern. However, if you do need to perform operations on multiple kinds of objects at once, then
using the visitor pattern makes sense.  For example the `remove_service()` function could have been
implemented as follows:

python
    def remove_service(self, service):
        self.services.remove(service)   # remove the service
        service.close()                 # close the underlying GATTService object, too.operations.
